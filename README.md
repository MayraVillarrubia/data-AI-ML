## Are you earning what you deserve? 




In this project, which starts with Python and Pandas and culminates in Tableau, I aim to answer the following questions for those of us working in the data world:

- Am I earning what I deserve?
- What are the highest-paying roles?
- How does the country I live in influence my salary?
- Which countries have the best-paying companies?

In [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/ThesecretsofDatasalariesAreyouearningwhatyoudeserve/Dashboard1?:language=es-ES&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) you can see an interactive dashboard, so you can try entering different data and draw your own conclusions.

Steps: 
1. Select your job title
2. Select your experience level
3. Select your country residence
4. Watch and analyze


_Disclaimer_: For each role, only the levels of experience and countries of residence that are available for that role in the dataset as of today are listed.

That is why, for example, for the job title of “AI Architect,” "Senior/Expert" and "Belgium" and "USA" are listed as options for level experience and country residence, respectively.
